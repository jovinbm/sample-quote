            Where does it come from?
            Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
            Latin
            literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
            Hampden-Sydney
            College
            in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and
            going through
            the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from
            sections
            1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written
            in
            45 BC.
            This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of
            Lorem
            Ipsum,
            "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

            The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
            1.10.32 and
            1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form,
            accompanied by
            English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
